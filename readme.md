Deploying Locally
-----------------------------------
- clone this repo
- you may need to install/update node, Git, Heroku CLI
- run: ```npm install```
- new terminal, run this command to watch for changes to the source files: ```npm run react-dev```
- new terminal, run to start the node dev server: ```npm run server-dev```

Deploying Remotely
-----------------------------------
- this project is currently hosted on Heroku at: https://morning-spire-64697.herokuapp.com/

ToDo(s)
-----------------------------------
- remove uses of jQuery - I used jQuery for convenience in certain methods, but the cost of loading jQuery likely does not exceed the benefits from deving with it.
- hookup backend integrations - you will likely see "login" and "signup" buttons that do not currently do anything. The purpose of this project was *not* to deploy a full functioning app, but there is certainly value in practicing and finishing out the project.
- Migrate to a dispatcher, reducer model to clean up code.
- Find a better bootstrap template for cleaner look and CSS transitions.
